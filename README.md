### Objective :

The objective is to provide a model to classify images of the cassava plant
into 4 disease categories and healthy, given 9,436 annotated images and 12,595
unlabeled images of cassava leaves. We tackled the problem with two phases, first we used the labeled images to find
our best model, then we fine-tune our best model using both the labeled and
unlabeled images.
